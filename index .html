    <p> He was <mark> Indian Sunni Hanafi Maturidi</mark> Islamic Scholar, theologian and a Sufi who was one of the main
        founders of the Deobandi Movement, starting from the Darul Uloom Deoband.</p>
    <p>
        Nanautawi was schooled at Nanauta, where he memorized the Quran and learned calligraphy.Aged nine, Nanautawi
        moved to Deoband where he studied at the madrasa of Karamat Hussain. The teacher at this "madrasa" was Mehtab
        Ali, the uncle of Mahmud Hasan Deobandi. Under the instruction of Mehtab Ali, Nanautawi completed the primary
        books of Arabic grammar and syntax.Thereafter, his mother sent him to Saharanpur, where his maternal grandfather
        Wajīhuddīn Wakīl, who was a poet of Urdu and Persian, lived. Wakīl enrolled his grandson in the Persian class of
        Muḥammad Nawāz Sahāranpūri, under whom, Nanautawi, then aged twelve, completed Persian studies.

        In 1844, Nanautawi joined the Delhi College, where he studied with Mamluk Ali Nanautawi.According to Asir
        Adrawi, "Nanautawi although was enrolled in the college, he would take private classes at his teachers home,
        instead of the college".He studied the major books with Mamluk Ali, including "mantiq" and philosophy, and few
        other books with Mufti Sadruddīn.According to Ashraf Ali Thanwi, "Mamluk Ali, the teacher of Rashid Ahmad
        Gangohi and Nanautawi was a government employee at Dār al-Baqā", in Delhi, which suggests that Nanautawi
        possibly studied there. Manazir Ahsan Gilani has tried to reconcile the reports concerning Nanautawi's education
        at the college. He says that, the name of Nanautawi appeared in the official registry of the college in the
        first year and argues, "whatsoever it is, but it is not right that he gained education there, since the
        starting".Nanautawi stayed in Delhi for around five or six years, and graduated, aged seventeen.Gīlāni says
        that, Nanautawi studied with Mamluk Ali Nanautawi, but not the syllabus of the college, rather studied at his
        home.It is commonly accepted that Nanautawi did not appear in the college exams</p>
